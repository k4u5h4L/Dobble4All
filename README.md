# Dobble4All
An offline site made using JS to play Dobble together!

## Issues:
* You may need to play it on a single computer.
* Score card and ranking system will be introduced later, as this is still a Work-In-Progress.

## References:
* Pictures got from [Dobble homepage](https://www.dobblegame.com/en/homepage/)
* Template used from [colorlib](https://colorlib.com/)


The algorithms required to generate cards are in the algorithms/ directory. It is not directly used by the site, but it is more like a reference code as to how the cards are generated.

Have fun, and stay tuned!!
